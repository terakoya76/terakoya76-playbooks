# Agent Orchestration

## Available Agents

Located in `~/.claude/agents/`:

| Agent | Purpose | When to Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| planner | Implementation planning | Complex features, refactoring |
| architect | System design, scalability | Architectural decisions |
| code-reviewer | Code quality review | After writing code |
| security-reviewer | Security vulnerability detection | Security-sensitive code, before commits |
| refactor-cleaner | Dead code cleanup | Code maintenance |
| doc-updater | Documentation & codemaps | Updating docs |
| serena-expert | Token-efficient app development | Component, API, system creation |

## Immediate Agent Usage

No user prompt needed:
1. Complex feature requests - Use **planner** agent
2. Code just written/modified - Use **code-reviewer** agent
3. Architectural decision - Use **architect** agent
4. Security-sensitive code changes - Use **security-reviewer** agent
5. App/component/API development - Use **serena-expert** agent

## Parallel Task Execution

ALWAYS use parallel Task execution for independent operations:

```markdown
# GOOD: Parallel execution
Launch 3 agents in parallel:
1. Agent 1: Security analysis of auth.ts
2. Agent 2: Performance review of cache system
3. Agent 3: Type checking of utils.ts

# BAD: Sequential when unnecessary
First agent 1, then agent 2, then agent 3
```

## Multi-Perspective Analysis

For complex problems, use split role sub-agents:
- Factual reviewer
- Senior engineer
- Security expert
- Consistency reviewer
- Redundancy checker
